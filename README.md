# Description

We are going to make a series of stacked pull requests.

In order to stack PRs, we start with one branch (bookmark), then branch off from there, repeat.

# What we'll build

For this demonstration, we will build out a feature of "saved searches".

We will break it up like so:

- saved-searches-schema
  - saved-searches-api
    - saved-searches-service
      - saved-searches-ui

In total, that's four pull requests.
